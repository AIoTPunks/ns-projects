# PKT Network Steward Meeting - December 21, 2019

## Decisions to be made
1. Accept [project #6](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/pull/6) (whitepaper and website)
  * Caleb: **yes**, [further explanation here](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/pull/6#pullrequestreview-333175149)
  * Neil: **yes**, as some concrete publicity that explains why PKT is not-just-another-cryptocurrency is needed
  * Arceliar: **no** (explanation to be posted)
  * Benhylau: **no**, [further explanation here](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/pull/6#issuecomment-567030370)
  * Adonis: **Yes**. We need to start somewhere
2. Accept [project #7](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/pull/7) (QT Wallet)
  * Caleb: **yes**, [further explanation here](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/pull/6#pullrequestreview-333175149)
  * Neil: **yes**, as usability and onboarding experiences are critical to project acceptance
  * Arceliar: **yes**, with some reservations about the precedent set by the payment schedule
  * Benhylau: **yes**, [further explanation here](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/pull/7#discussion_r359731820)
  * Adonis: **yes** because we won't grow past developers without a UI
3. Earmark entire budget of all projects which have been accepted to-date.
  * Caleb: **yes**, reason is because more projects will be proposed and we otherwise risk accepting more projects than we are able to fund.
  * Neil: **yes**, as it shows NS planning and doesn't involve moving funds, adds necessary pressure for milestones to succeed or PKT will burn
  * Arceliar: **yes**, as an administrative / accounting process that we need to do to avoid going over budget    * Caleb: Left as is absent reply after clarification.
  * Benhylau: **yes** as a short-term strategy before we have a healthy pipeline of projects, but not as a long-term strategy to override the built-in coin burn policy
  * Adonis: **yes** because moving PKT in this way will generate more developer interest
4. Transfer full funds for all accepted projects so that they will not burn.
  * Caleb: **no**, I initially proposed this but after discussion with the other NS team members, I have changed my opinion. We will pay out 40mn PKT to the two projects immediately which will put the "PKT begins burning" date approximately 40 days into the future, we should notify the applicants that if PKT begins burning and they have not brought in their first milestones, we will consider suspending their projects in order to accept other projects because we would prefer to accept qualified projects than allow PKT to burn.
  * Neil: **no**, for same reasons as Arceliar has mentioned below
  * Arceliar: **no** because this can leave us with spendable coins if the project is cancelled for any reason, which can look corrupt (we can't *prove* that we didn't intend the project to fail just so we could keep access to the coins). It defeats the purpose of having coin burn if we're just going to bypass it when it's inconvenient
  * Benhylau: **no**, we should consider making a transfer only when that time comes
  * Adonis: **yes** because we will lose the PKT anyway, so at least we stand to convert it into useful work

## Resolutions
* We have agreed to fund [project #6](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/pull/6) and [project #7](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/pull/7)
* We will administratively earmark funds for the completion of these projects, meaning that new projects will not be immediately accepted if it would put in Jeopardy the budget of ongoing projects.
* We will not make any transfers of coins to prevent them from burning.
* In the event that no project has reached a milestone warranting additional payout by the time that coins begin to burn once again, we may revisit the question of whether to suspend an ongoing project in order to un-earmark the coins for the completion of that project in order that another project may be accepted.

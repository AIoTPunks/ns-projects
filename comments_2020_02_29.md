# This pad is for review of 2020_02_28 project proposals

**NOTE**: This was copied from [a cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/2/code/view/Rd08PkzNq1av9W6aRNYetfwh+9YYFggxahKx7lv90Ko/present/) where the Network Steward team left notes about the projects in a publically-viewable forum. Private discussion of projects between Network Steward team members was forbidden so this document contains all communications which went on between them.

The NS team must review each of the following projects and produce a number between 0 and 1 for each of the evaluation [5 evaluation criteria](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/blob/master/acceptance_process.md#evaluation-criteria).

## Instructions to NS team

This pad should be used to communicate any information which might help the other NS team members in making a determination. Votes must not be revealed until 2020-03-08 because doing so would spoil the bidding process.

Please review the files linked below which are pulled to branches and cannot be updated by the applicants.

Checkout the ns-projects repository and edit the [vote_2020_02_29.py](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/blob/master/vote_2020_02_29.py) file to add your evaluations of the projects for each of the 5 criteria. You can run the script in order to simulate results with you as the only voter.

If you consider a project [unacceptable](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/blob/master/acceptance_process.md#unacceptable-projects), set the `scope`, `risk`, or `hazard` value to zero, depending on the reason for it being unacceptable. You can also set both 'short' and 'long' to zero if you consider it unacceptable for reason of having no useful impact. Avoid using zero in any of your votes unless you consider the project unacceptable.

**DO NOT SHOW YOUR VOTE TO ANYONE UNTIL 2020-03-08**

* **Arc** General comment, not specific to any one proposal: these proposals really need to include disclosure of any associations with the NS or other conflicts of interest. We need that information to properly judge how hazardous a proposal is. Failing to disclose conflicts, when they exist, is quite literally the worst thing I can think of from a hazard standpoint (hyperbolic examples of bad proposals, e.g. someone proposing to open a darkweb assassination market, are at least *transparently* hazardous). Since this appears to be something that literally every proposal neglected to address, and it's the first round of proposals, I don't think it's indefensible for us to ignore a lack of disclosure and judge projects as best we can this time, but this **cannot** happen again.

## 2020_02_29_Price_Display
[2020_02_29_Price_Display.md](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/blob/2020_02_29_Price_Display/projects/2020_02_29_Price_Display.md)

* 8mn budget
* 1/4 frontload
* 1.5 PM
* 5.33 mn/PM - highest cost/PM

* **Arc** I believe the seigniorage example given in this proposal is (unintentionally) misleading and overly simplistic. The example formula using hash rate and cost of energy makes sense with a bitcoin-like mining algorithm designed to be computationally hard, but it doesn't account for pkt's bandwidth-hard (and/or memory-hard) algorithm, or that the requirements and payouts for block mining or ann mining can differ significantly. Note that if the cost estimation remains accurate without accounting for bandwidth, then either the approximation is in error, or the mining algorithm has failed to be sufficiently bandwidth-hard (which kind of defeats the purpose of pkt). So in addition to the assumption that the hardware is a gridfinity miner, I believe assumptions would also need to be made about the available anns in the mining pool and the network available to the mining hardware. Considering that it's only an approximation to begin with (and one that's only valid when the margin between value and production cost is small), it would be very difficult to convince me that the seigniorage is accurate to within more than an order of magnitude. While I do expect that the general trends would probably be accurate (e.g. if the seigniorage price goes up, the value probably also goes up by a roughly similar factor), I think trying to display a price in e.g. USD would be actively harmful to the network. If people see the ticker and take the number seriously, but the number turns out to be inaccurate, then in the best case scenario it under-values the currency and may harm adoption. In the worst case scenario, it over values the currency and turns the project into an accidental NS-funded panzi scheme. As such, I believe it would be highly inappropriate to accept this proposal until the NS or interested parties have had time to more thoroughly research the problem.

## 2020_02_29_PKT_Faucet
[2020_02_29_PKT_Faucet.md](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/blob/2020_02_29_PKT_Faucet/projects/2020_02_29_PKT_Faucet.md)

* 16mn budget - plus 200k/month
* 3/16th frontload
* 12 PM
* 1.33 mn/PM
* Based on feature-set, 12 person-months appears high
* **Arc** So to summarize: the applicant proposes to distribute up to 2.4 M pkt over 1 year. The fee to do so is an additional 16 M pkt. That looks like about 87% overhead. If we consider this proposal to be analogous to donating to a charity that's going to redistribute the funds, then this gets [the lowest rating possible](https://www.charitywatch.org/our-charity-rating-process#how-grades-are-calculated). Since the applicant and members of the project team are also known by some NS members (which *really* needs to be mentioned in the proposals themselves moving forward), awarding a project that uses funds so inefficiently would give a strong appearance of nepotism. It's honestly difficult for me to overstate how unacceptable this is. Let me put it this way: at work, if I saw someone awarding a contract based on a proposal that looked anything like this, I'd be obligated to report this to the office of internal audits so they can open up a formal fraud investigation with the state auditor's office. Let me be clear -- I'm not saying that the faucet idea itself is bad, but in its current form this is **not OK**, and frankly speaking, this would be inexcusable if not for the fact that this is the first round of proposals, I would just have to assume that the applicant is trying to defraud the NS and disregard any future applications (or quit if the NS makes it a habit of approving something so transparently hazardous -- that's not what I signed up for, and it really wouldn't be worth my time anymore).
* **Caleb** I like the idea of using the charity model to evaluate this proposal

## 2020_02_29_Cloud_Computing
[2020_02_29_Cloud_Computing.md](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/blob/2020_02_29_Cloud_Computing/projects/2020_02_29_Cloud_Computing.md)

* 30mn budget
* 1/6th frontload
* 60 PM (declared 60-120 PM)
* 0.5 mn/PM (0.25 mn/PM if the time spent is 120 PM) - lowest cost/PM
* Notice the phrase: "The software will be available under applicable open source licenses when possible"

* **Arc** Unless the applicants have cracked the secret to high-speed fully holomorphic encryption, and found a way to transparently run existing code in such an environment (in which case, money is probably the least of their worries and we shouldn't be wasting funds on them), then I don't see this being up to par (never mind better) from a safety perspective. I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that most users (businesses) will have at least some private information or proprietary business logic that they need to run on their servers. If they run their code on one of the major existing cloud computing platforms, then they can be reasonably sure that the provider won't steal their secrets -- since, if they did, it would be easy to bring a lawsuit against them. It's much harder to sue someone when they're just some random node in a distributed network and payed by a cryptocurrency, and that lack of obvious legal recourse means it could be a very hard sell for anyone with anything secret involved in their workflow. That said, anecdotally, I can think of a workflow where the most computationally expensive part (by a hilarious margin) should be fine in a network like this. So I think this is definitely still useful to have, just probably not to quite the extent that the applicants imply. I just wanted to mention that aloud in case anyone else hadn't thought about it and wants to take that into account when scoring the project.

* 30mn budget
* 1/5 frontload
* 10 PM
* 3 mn/PM
* **Caleb:** This applicant requested project ideas, so this application is based on a rough spec which I provided, the time estimation and costing was their own
* This project can provide link quality information for 2020_02_28_pkt_vpn_utility VPNs
* Success criteria are perhaps most strict of any proposal, because there already exists a working prototype to copy
* This project is targetting an item which was suggested by the NS
* As this project will likely grow to contain advanced technologies which are necessary to the functioning of the network, this project's license is likely to help ward off potential patent trolls.
* No project maintainer is specified

## 2020_02_28_Proposal_Cjdns_wifi_based_interface
[2020_02_28_Proposal_Cjdns_wifi_based_interface.md](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/blob/2020_02_28_cjdns_wifi_based_interface_proposal/projects/2020_02_28_Proposal_Cjdns_wifi_based_interface.md)

* 36mn budget
* 1/4 frontload
* 12 PM
* 3 mn/PM
* There is a missing milestone 1, there is a kickoff and then a list of requirements for completion. I think the NS should assume that there is a milestone 1 heading on line 52
* **Caleb:** This applicant requested project ideas, so this application is based on a rough spec which I provided, the time estimation and costing was their own
* This project is targetting an item which was suggested by the NS
* **Neil Alexander:** This project certainly has interesting and valiant goals, and I have no doubt that we will be very interested in Wi-Fi as the network matures. However, I would take note that building real-world demos, particularly on iOS and Android mobile devices, will be high risk due to the limitations of these platforms.

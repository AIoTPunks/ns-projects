## Project summary

Currently, there exists a chat software for the PKT community at [http://pkt.chat](http://pkt.chat). It is browser-based, but users can install the Mattermost mobile app to connect with it.

However, with the base Mattermost chat app,  push notifications are not supported, so users aren’t alerted when someone messages them.

We would like to implement the push notification system that will enable smartphone users to to receive these notifications, improving the user experience of the PKT chat ecosystem.

## Team and Past Work

The team includes [Christofer Koutelieris](mailto:soricine@gmail.com) and Adonis Gaitatzis. Christopher and Adonis have both worked on PKT mobile software for iOS before an as-yet-unreleased software, and Adonis has worked directly on the PKT blockchain as well as the VPN Utility project, the Telegram trading bot, and the PKT price ticker.

## Project Deliverables

When the project is complete, we will deliver to the pkt.cash operators:

-   A working push-notification server configuration
-   A PKT-branded Android APK and source code
-   A PKT-branded iOS IPA and source code


The project includes sensitive information including private keys, which should not be revealed to the public. Therefore our deliverables must be handed over to a verified pkt.cash operator rather than open source to the public.

## Success criteria

At the end of this project, we will have:

-   Push notification service running that enables PKT chat users to receive message alerts on their smartphones when they are not using the app.

-   PKT-branded Android and iOS Mattermost apps, which interact with the PKT chat server and the push proxy.

## Payments

* Hourly Rate:
  * The team's hourly rate is estimated at 2,666.66 PKT/hour based on a PKT price of 0.03 USD / PKT at the time of writing.


## Milestones

1.  Push Notification Software
2.  Push Notification service running online
3.  Customize and build Android app
4.  Customize and build iOS app

### Milestone 0 (Kickoff)

We have found the Mattermost instructions for deploying a push notification server, including testing the mobile app on an Android smartphone.

After the project is accepted, the Network Steward will pay XXX PKT

Figure out how time this took, convert that number to PKT using the price at [http://price.pkt.cash](http://price.pkt.cash), then multiply by 120% to get how much PKT we should get paid at this step, then delete this italicized text.

### Milestone 1

#### Push notification software running on a server

At this step we will have the Mattermost push notification software running on a server, but will not be yet connected to a public website.

Estimated man-hours: 15

#### Payout

After a report is delivered on this milestone and it is approved by the NS, the NS will send 40,000 PKT.


### Milestone 2

#### Push notification software running on a server

At this step we will connect a web server, likely NGINX to the Mattermost push proxy software, so that the push proxy can operate on the public Internet over secure HTTPS.

Estimated man-hours: 15

#### Payout

After a report is delivered on this milestone and it is approved by the NS, the NS will send 40,000 PKT.

### Milestone 3

#### PKT-branded Android App

At this step we will have an unsigned APK file that we can distribute for testing which is securely connected to the Mattermost proxy server and which uses PKT-themed colors and icons

Estimated man-hours: 100

#### Payout

After a report is delivered on this milestone and it is approved by the NS, the NS will send 266,666 PKT.

### Milestone 4

#### PKT-branded iOS App

At this step we will have an unsigned IPA file that we can distribute for testing which is securely connected to the Mattermost proxy server and which uses PKT-themed colors and icons.

Estimated man-hours: 100

#### Payout

After a report is delivered on this milestone and it is approved by the NS, the NS will send 266,666 PKT.

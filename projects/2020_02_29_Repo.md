## 1. Project Relevance to the PKT Network

In the Network Stewart's charter, one of the key objectives is ["the development of open-source networking software"](https://pkt-cash.github.io/www.pkt.cash/steward/). 

Even though GitHub is good for developers, we propose the creation and maintenance of a dedicated Debian (and later other distributions, such as Fedora/RedHat) [software repository](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository) for mesh-enabled software, as well as a website front-end.

## 2. Project Deliverables
The key deliverables will be:

1. Scripts to automatically compile, sign, and add the software to a repo, such as: cjdns, yggdrasil, pktd/pktwallet/btcctl.

2. Hosting of the above.


### 2.1 Wireframe

The following image is an example mockup of the website for illustration purposes. The design and location of the features may differ in the final version.

### 2.2 Development overview

* **Website:** The deliverables are a new website. The website domain will be defined during the development stage.

* **License:** The software will be available under the [ISC](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC) license. All artistic non-software assets will be available under the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

* **Mantainer:** The maintainer of this software will be: Jeff Johnson

* **Outbound links:** The website may include banners linking to other resources related to the PKT network, such as [Gridfinity](https://www.gridfinity.com/) or a wallet service.

* **Language:** We will use the standard distribution provided packaging tools where available.

* **Open source:** The software will be hosted on https://github.com/pkt-cash, if the network steward wishes it so.


### 2.3 Milestones
The following are milestones for the progress of the project by which the network steward can evaluate the success of the project.

* [ ] **M0 - Kickoff**
<br> At the kickoff of the project, the network steward will grant 1 million PKT to the applicants, and the project will begin.

* [ ] **M1 - Complete version**
<br> Milestone 1 will be achieved when the software repository is live. Upon completion of Milestone 1, a report will be written, and the applicant will seek approval from the network steward. Upon approval, payment of 3 million PKT will be issued. At this point, the development stage of the project will conclude.

### 2.4 Team qualifications
* **Jeff Johnson** is a UNIX system admin. He's built cjdns-based urban distributed mesh networks used in production in South Florida.

## 3. Success Criteria
* At least one major software program successfully packaged, with at least one independent user of that package.
* At least 90% achievement of the described features.

## 4. Payments
Each payments shall be distributed to the following address: `pkt1q2dtjhfmajy6f0u7dampk8q7ak882mryenxx2fr`

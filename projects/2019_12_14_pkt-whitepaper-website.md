## Project summary

After seeing the best and worst of both the Internet and of cryptocurrency projects, I am more excited about the potential of PKT Cash than I have been about any project or protocol in years.
The objective of this Project is to help the PKT project become more accessible to existing and potential community members by writing a detailed white paper and building a well-designed website where people can gain a deeper understanding of the PKT blockchain and ecosystem. If we are going to reach scale, there needs to be in-depth information on how PKT works and how to use it for people of all technical backgrounds. 

I humbly request the support of the Network Stewards so that I can devote my time, talent, connections, mindshare, and reputation to supporting and enabling the PKT Cash community to achieve its visionary ambitions with easily accessible writing and video for people everywhere to join in. 

The first step towards broad awareness is a white paper. Once the white paper is completed it will require a website to access it. This Project proposes for me as a domain expert to write the PKT white paper, and to coordinate with a web team to develop a dynamic website for interested parties to access and grasp the inner workings of PKT. With a white paper and website in place, the PKT community can begin to scale to achieve its vision. 
 
### Who am I and Why me?
My name is Alex Lightman and I am a futurist and technologist for almost 40 years. PKT is a unique hybrid of telecommunications protocol, community, and cryptocurrency, and I have unique expertise in thought leadership, invention, marketing, PR, product and service creation, alliance building, community building, business ecosystem development related to IPv6, 4G wireless broadband, Blockchain, and cryptocurrency. 

A few bullet points about my relevant background:

* Author of 16 crypto white papers, the kind that not only bring together focused teams, but also keep teams from overpromising and from running afoul of government regulators. 

* Keynote speaker at over 40 crypto events around the world, including with Vitalik Buterin at Blockchain Futurist in Toronto, a speech that received global television coverage for five minutes on CNBC.

* Organized and chaired over a dozen IPv6 events that brought together representatives of over 40 national governments, over 40 US federal agencies, and hundreds of corporations, universities, standards bodies and nonprofits.

* In order to get IPv6 mandated by the US federal government, I got the chairman of the Government and Reform Committee to hold hearings on Internet Leadership. I chose the industry panel of expert witnesses and the government panel, testified, and got acceptance by the CTO of the federal government of my package of policy proposals submitted along with my testimony. As far as I know, this is the only time someone has been able to get a technology or telecommunications protocol mandated by the US federal government. 

* I’ve won four global awards for leadership and community building of new technology innovations and telecommunications protocols, including the first Economist magazine Reader’s Award on behalf of 4G wireless broadband, after a five month vote open to the entire world, vs. Elon Musk and five other innovators.

* Almost 1,000 appearances on television, including 150 times on Science Channel programs.

I will be working with my colleagues Josh Berger and Jesse Berger. Josh has 10+ years in marketing and web development. He has an international team of developers willing to work for PKT Cash to create a dynamic, designed, and in-depth website to host the content and white paper. 

Jesse has 15+ years experience in brand creation and development as well as copywriting. The brands he has created are Radical Studio, including its publishing division and IP comic book studio with over 40 titles with 23 published works, including Hercules, and the feature film Oblivion. Jesse also created Pet Hemp Company and Mantle Networks, to name a few. Jesse has a deep knowledge of the PKT project which will be helpful in crafting communications that will be taken seriously in both crypto and traditional industries.
## Project deliverables
The key deliverable will be the white paper, copywriting, digital assets, branding, and other web deliverables and materials needed to explain the project to average consumers and potential community members. Additionally, the deliverables include a dynamic website to host the content.

### White Paper

* Community Inquiry: I have a list of 54 questions that when answered provide the basis for a complete crypto white paper; one that makes the complex comprehensible, the intangible graspable and the future urgent. Upon receiving notice from the Network Stewards of acceptance of this proposal (or a modified/edited counter proposal that is substantially similar, I will provide the questions to my designated point of contact (POC) at PKT who will get approved answers to the questions. 

* Assistance with Questions: Throughout the process, I am available to discuss and clarify the questions and to brainstorm about the answers. However, I endeavour not to “lead the witness” and tell you what I think. My job, as I see it, is to be a neutral “integrating synthesist” who builds a house out the raw materials of the answers to the 54 questions.

* Within 30 calendar days of receiving the 54 approved answers and any relevant supporting materials, I will deliver a first draft white paper. Of the 16 that I have done, half of them were so in tune with client expectations and requirements that there were zero changes requested of me and the first draft was put the work. The others went through one to three rounds of comments until they were finished. Each round took about two to four days on each side for the revisions. 

* Congratulations. You now have your completed PKT white paper!

* Powerpoint Deck: I will take the details of the whitepaper and compile them into a deck to use as an evangelist of the project on a global scale. 

* Presentation video: Working with Jesse and Josh, I will create a video presentation of the deck to be displayed on the website. This video will help users understand the project and excite them to dig in deeper.

#### Whitepaper Milestones:

### Website

We wish to build a community-facing website where users can easily access information regarding PKT Cash and adoption. This website will clearly articulate the mission of the project with steps on how to adopt the technology. 
Custom design: Jesse and Josh will work with their design team to create a custom website design that clearly articulates the brand and messaging of the PKT community.

* Copywriting: Jesse will extract prose from the white paper and adjust the text to fit within the confines of the site. 

* Web development: Josh will work with his development team to take the designs and code them into a functional website.

* Deliver: Josh and Jesse will provide notes to the development of the site and tweak it for delivery.

#### Hosting
Website will be hosted on a dedicated VPS owned by Josh Berger using the pkt.cash domain for the first year with the intent of moving it to a distributed cloud built on the PKT network.

#### Milestones

* Custom designed website (4 weeks)

* Copywriting (2 weeks)

* Designs coded into website (4 weeks)

* Final revisions (2 weeks)

**Total time: 74 days**

## Project Milestones
The following are milestones for the progress of the project by which the network steward can evaluate the success of the project.

### M0 Kickoff

At the kickoff of the project we humbly ask that the network steward grant PKT 20,000,000 to the applicant and the project will begin. This number is larger than usual due to the fact that we are beginning two projects at the same time with fiat cash requirements. PKT10,000,000 will be allocated to the White Paper kickoff and PKT10,000,000 will be allocated to the Website kickoff

### M1 Milestone 1:

Whitepaper v1 delivery grant PKT 5,000,000

### M2 Milestone 2:

Delivery of website design will grant PKT 5,000,000

### M3 Milestone 3:

Completion of white paper edits grant PKT 10,000,000

### M4 Milestone 4:

Turn in video and launch site and grant final payment of 10,015,000

At this point the project will reach the end of it's explicit funding, however the applicant commits to the long term maintenance of the website and the network steward commits to continuing interest in the evolution of the site.

## Legal

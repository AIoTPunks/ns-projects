## Project summary

[Gridfinity (GitHub author: johnsonjh) has been helping the PKT network with critical tasks required to maintain and keep the blockchain operating properly for over a year.](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktd/pulls?page=7&q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajohnsonjh) The present project proposes that the Network Steward provides support for the expenses of the ongoing technical services and associated administrative tasks that will continue to be provided by Gridfinity to the PKT project. We are not seeking any retroactive payment, but we wish the Network Steward's support to enable us to continue providing the same level of technical services and support moving forward.

## 1. Project Relevance to the PKT Network

The PKT blockchain often experiences critical problems such as pktd bugs, database corruption, pktwallet malfunctions (including wallet database corruption), and block mining stalls, announcement mining deadlocks, block and announcement handler failures, pool master malfunctions, pool paymaker bugs, required filesystem, Linux kernel, and TCP stack configuration and tuning to allow proper functioning of the PKT suite (which is not possible on a default configuration with any current distribution), nodejs monitoring and tuning (as the nodejs portions of PKT suite also do not properly operate on default configurations of LTS/stable nodejs distributions), and various other issues. There are ongoing concerns that additional failures are inevitable and will require contuining attention. 

For one year, Gridfinity has been on the frontline, providing free technical support to the PKT project to solve each emergency situation, which has stalled the blockchain, and done so in a robust and timely fashion. These failures are not due to misconfiguration, misapplication, deficient deployment practices, nor based on inappropriate, or unsound assumptions regarding the operation of the PKT software suite. Every time that Gridfinity spends resources to volunteer for the PKT Network, Gridfinity's operations and development efforts stall, which has already seriously impacted our budget and company goals.

We believe that without around the clock technical support, the PKT Network wouldn't be running, and it's in the best interest of the entire PKT community to have on-duty technical support services available to maintain an always-on and functioning blockchain. [Gridfinity (author: johnsonjh) has a proven record of success in this matter.](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktd/pulls?page=7&q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajohnsonjh)

The proposed project provides a very specific and positive short-term impact to the PKT project, that is, ensuring the PKT software suite (including the PKT pool implementation) is running in a production environment at Gridfinity, as an operating PKT pool is infrastructure that is required and necessary for the continued existence of the PKT blockchain. The long-term results would be a better tested, stable, and mature PKT software suite, all of which are vital requirements to build trustworthiness in the PKT Network. 

Reliable and well-tested software has inherent benefits over less thoroughly tested and lower-quality software, such as the ability of the software itself to attract a wider range of users, on its own merits, while avoiding a situation where potential community members would become frustrated and disillusioned, even potentially abandoning the PKT project altogether for competitors or alternatives.


### 2. Team and Past Work

* **Jeff Johnson** is a UNIX system administrator. He's built cjdns-based distributed urban mesh networks used in production in South Florida. Jeff has already succesfully provided several solutions and bugfixes to the PKT suite powering the PKT blockchain, and works continually to identify, isolate, and avoid additional failure modes. 

* **Jonathan Owens** is a blockchain entrepreneur since the early stages of the technology. He has founded several successful companies in the space, including [Narwhal](https://narwhal.ai/) and [Gridfinity](http://gridfinity.com/).

## 3. Service Overview

### 3.1 Objective 

Our goal is to maintain an ongoing arrangement equivalent to a support/service level agreement with the PKT Project, in which Gridfinity would be available to provide services for debugging, root cause analysis, or other assistance as required, with no delay of the start of work to exceed 72 hours.

### 3.2 Service Deliverables

To achieve the goals above, we will provide on-duty technical support for future technical issues that the PKT Network will experience over the next 3 months, starting on the date the Network Steward funds the present proposal. At the end of the 3-month support period, we are open to renewing another Tech Support period by submitting a new Network Steward proposal.

The technical support tasks include the following:

* **1)** Collaborative debugging assistance within staff expertise. We plan to work as a team with the PKT Project to solve bugs.

* **2)** System Administration Support (including monitoring and in-production observation)

We will test and contribute to the existing PKT and related software: cjdns, PacketCrypt, PKT suite (including pktctl and pktd). Any new software created within the context of this Network Steward proposal will be created under the Artistic, MIT, or ISC license, Simplified 2-clause BSD License, or any other license in compliance with the Open Source Initiative (OSI) Open Source Definition after receiving explicit approval from the Network Steward, and it will be hosted on [github.com/pkt-cash](https://github.com/pkt-cash), if the network steward wishes it so. Any code contributions to existing licensed software within the PKT suite will be licensed in accordance with the licensing requirements of the software being modified.

### 3.3 Execution Strategy

Our execution strategy incorporates highly qualified personnel, and a responsive approach. We will take care of issues identified by Gridfinity's team or reported directly by an official member of the PKT Project or Network Steward board.

### 3.4 Success Criteria

* **Success Criteria =** Achieving sixty (60) accepted pull requests during the 3-month period of Tech Support of the present Network Steward proposal.

As a reference, [Gridfinity (author: johnsonjh) has 96 Closed pull requests](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktd/pulls?page=7&q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajohnsonjh) to date, and [60 Open pull requests](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktd/pulls/johnsonjh) to date.

### 3.5 Milestones

We will keep an average of 20 accepted pull requests per month.

* **Milestone 1:** 20 accepted pull requests.

  * Expected payment = 1 million PKT


* **Milestone 2:** 20 accepted pull requests _(40 cumulative accepted pull requests since the begging of the Tech Support)._

  * Expected payment = 1 million PKT
 

* **Milestone 3:** 20 accepted pull requests _(60 cumulative accepted pull requests since the begging of the Tech Support)._

  * Expected payment = 1 million PKT

## 4 Payments

### 4.1 Price Breakdown

* **Hours per month:** 

  * We estimate that our team currently spends an average of 20 hours per week working on troubleshooting the PKT network, and we project that the workload will continue to be the same for the next 3 months. The equivalent average hours per month is **80 hours / month**.

* **Hourly rate:** 

  * Gridfinity's hourly rate is **12,500 PKT/hour**, which includes the technical member salary, and other general overhead, such as Gridfinity's administrative tasks, equipment, supplies, and other expenses.

* **PKT monthly payment:** 

  * 80 hours/month x 12,500 PKT/hour = **1 million PKT/month**

### 4.2 PKT Transfers
Each payment shall be distributed to the following address: 

  * `pkt1qny8evhadazh75w0awaglw53cs7pztcycsxd30d`

Payments will be distributed to Gridfinity monthly, or, alternately, a different schedule negotiated with the Network Steward.

## 1. Project Relevance to the PKT Network

> "The best way to create a more decentralized, more inclusive internet is to create artificial demand for bandwidth" ─ [Caleb James DeLisle](https://www.gridfinity.com/packetcrypt-mining-bandwidth-into-the-future-caleb-james-delisle/)

One of the originating reasons for the PKT Network has been to create a more decentralized and inclusive internet. As of today, there is no public use of PKT for purposes other than mining and privately transacting PKT Cash. One of the most genuine ways of opening the adoption of PKT to the vast spectrum of uses of the Internet is by creating a marketplace where users can buy and sell compute and storage for any purpose in a decentralized fashion amongst themselves. The purpose of this network steward proposal is to create software to facilitate such a cloud computing marketplace.

### 1.1 Understanding the markets

The cloud computing, storage, and high-performance computing services industry had revenues of [$80 billion in 2018, and it is growing 46% annually](https://www.canalys.com/static/press_release/2019/pr20190204.pdf). The image below shows the [market share](https://www.canalys.com/static/press_release/2019/pr20190204.pdf), which is dominated by centralized providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS):

[<div style="max-width:500px" align="middle"> <div style="max-width:80%"> <img src="https://tfeed.gridfinity.com/MarketS.png" width=80%> </div> </div>](https://www.canalys.com/static/press_release/2019/pr20190204.pdf) <br>

Microsoft and Google have the 2nd and 3rd biggest market share, and the rest of the market is fragmented among dozens of other companies, including IBM, Alibaba, Oracle, Linode, OVH, Digital Ocean, and others.

The worldwide public cloud service industry represents [$214 billion](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-04-02-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-g), when adding Cloud Business Process Services (BPaaS), Cloud Application Infrastructure Services (PaaS), Cloud Application Services (SaaS), Cloud Management and Security Services, and Cloud System Infrastructure Services (IaaS).

### 1.2 Understanding the users

Currently, the most common customers of cloud computing services are businesses looking to outsource their servers, resulting in more flexibility to the companies to scale or reduce computing operations without the need to buy more hardware or leave idle equipment. 90% of the users of cloud computing services are small and mid-size companies, while [10% are large enterprises](https://www.contino.io/insights/whos-using-aws). Businesses are an educated type of customers who choose a service evaluating factors such as safety, quality, reliability, and price. 

### 1.3 Competitive advantage

When we develop software for such a marketplace, we are aware that we need to create a solution which enables participants to provide high-quality, world-class services to compete with the current solutions on the market. 

We intend to create software which allows users to offer similar features to existing providers in the market, but also the following additional competitive advantages:

* **Robustness:** Since there will be no centralized network, but instead one created by the resources of the participants, data is distributed, and accidents in one part of the network won't affect the entire network.
* **Safety:** By distributing the network and encrypting data, we can offer a  high level of data protection.


## 2. Project Deliverables
The key deliverables of this project will create the following:
1. Reference specifications for front-end and back-end software.
2. Software to run on nodes to allow using them as part of a distributed cloud computing market. This will likely be built on top of and integrating existing solutions.
3. A system for payment settlement using PKT Cash.

### 2.1 How it works

The following steps outline the general user story:

* **Step 1:** The user will visit a website run by a particpant (or installs the softare which will be used to participate themselves).

* **Step 2:** The user maintains a PKT wallet which will be used to send and receive PKT Cash as payment for services rendered or provided.

* **Step 3:** The user then interacts with a provider of services via a web interface.

* **Step 4:** The user can choose offer their own services on the marketplace as well.

### 2.2 Target Features

1. Web-browser based administartion.
2. Container based design.
3. Payments between users handled with PKT Cash.
4. A backup solution.
5. Allowing participants to collaborate.
6. Ensure security and reliability.

### 2.3 Pricing 

* **Supply side:** The owner of each host machine shall determine the pricing that they charge for offering the use of their host machine.
* **Demand side:** The cloud computing consumers will be able to choose their preferred hosting based on pricing, trust, geographical location, or other factors.

We will function as a maintainer of the software stack used for providing the services as well as connecting the supply side and the demand sides.

### 2.4 Development overview

* **Repository:** The software will be hosted online, such as on https://github.com/pkt-cash, if the network steward wishes it so.

* **License:** The software will be available under applicable open source licenses when possible. All new artistic non-software assets will be available under the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

* **Mantainer:** The maintainer/manager of this software will be Jeff Johnson.

* **Website domain:** The website domain will be defined during the development stage.

* **Outbound links:** The website may include banners linking to other resources related to the PKT network, such as [Gridfinity](https://www.gridfinity.com/) or a wallet service.


### 2.5 Milestones
The following are milestones for the progress of the project by which the network steward can evaluate the success of the project.

* [ ] **M0 - Kickoff**
<br> At the kickoff of the project, the network steward will grant 5 million PKT to the applicants, and the project will begin.

* [ ] **M1 - Minimum Viable Product**
<br>Milestone 1 will focus on developing the specifications and requirements of software and protocols which will be used by nodes particiapting in such a decentralized computing and storage network. Upon the completion of Milestone 1, a report will be written, and the applicant will seek approval from the network steward to go forward with development. The network steward shall pay 5 million PKT for the completion of this milestone.

* [ ] **M2 - User interface**
<br>Milestone 2 will focus on developing a reference user interface design to be used by participants in such a decentralized computing and storage network. Upon the completion of Milestone 2, a report will be written, and the applicant will seek approval from the network steward to go forward with development. The network steward shall pay 5 million PKT for the completion of this milestone.

* [ ] **M3 - Payment system**
<br>Milestone 3 will be achieved when a distributed payment/settlement system is designed, to allow the users to safely transact. Upon completion of Milestone 3, a report will be written, and the applicant will seek approval from the network steward to go forward with development. Upon approval, payment of 5 million PKT will be issued for the completion of this milestone.

* [ ] **M4 - Reference system**
<br>Milestone 4 will be the development of a working implementation based upon the approved designs. Upon completion, payment of 10 million PKT will be issued. At this point, the initial development stage of the project will conclude.

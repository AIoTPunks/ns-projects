# *PKT Faucet*

This is a One Person Software Project. I plan create a new Open Source software project.

* Project Name: *PKT Faucet*
* Contact Email: *backupbrain@gmail.com*
* Requested rate: *65 EUR / Hour*
* Total requested contribution: *26,460 EUR (23,960 EUR wages, 2,500 EUR treasury)*
* Maximum requested PKT contribution: *1,058,400 PKT*
* PKT address to pay to: *pkt1q6703yw8nrw2trewla4m3qkm376ttg5dnmpcvg6*
* Repository with software which will be improved: *https://github.com/backupbrain/pkt-faucet*

## About me
I am:

* [x] The lead maintainer of the software
* [ ] A regular contributor to the software
* [ ] An occasional contributor to the software
* [x] Not a contributor yet

I am an avid open source contributor and technology educator.

Open source projects include:
* [Python/Django Utility to Add Secure Headers to HTTP Headers](https://github.com/backupbrain/drf-keypair-permissions)

## Project deliverables

I intend to create a website, API, and utility that allows people to register on the website to receive a small grant in PKT to an address they specify.

The purpose of this project is to allow new developers and contributors to the PKT project to begin working on PKT software which might require features such as sending PKT or viewing transactions. Aquiring PKT for this purpose should be very easy so as to reduce the friction of development. Developers should not have to negotiate with traders, buy other crypto and trade it, or mine PKT in order to run tests. They should be able to drop PKT into an address and then begin testing.

As developers sometimes need to access PKT for their projects in multiple places (for example multiple wallet client softwares), it makes sense to allow registered developers to request PKT more than once, but to give a maximum daily allowance.

To reduce the risk of people creating dummy accounts and emptying the treasury, human-verification and queuing systems will be employed.

I'm requesting 100,000 PKT be put into a treasury that can be dispursed by the faucet. This would allow the faucet to give 1 PKT to 274 addresses per day for one year (or longer if the faucet is used less). 

* Deliverable 1:
    * Automated PKT Spending so that PKT can be sent programmatically
    * Estimated time / cost: 24 hours / 1,560 EUR
    * After delivery, the project developer should be able to use software to automate the sending of PKT from one address to another and to know the current balance of the sending address.
* Deliverable 2:
    * Website that allows users to request PKT
    * Estimated time / cost: 200 hours / 11,200 EUR
    * After delivery, a developer should be able to register with an email address and receive a one-time-pin, log in and out, reset and change their password, and request PKT to an address
* Deliverable 3:
    * Website hardening
    * Estimated time / cost: 200 hours / 11,200 EUR
    * After delivery, only users who complete a CAPTCHA and provide a valid smartphone and non-blacklisted email address will be allowed to create an account
* Deliverable 4:
    * Treasury filled with PKT and ready to send to registered users
    * Estimated cost: 100,000 PKT
    * After delivery, PKT can be delivered to users who complete the registration process and log-in. 100000 PKT allows 275 people per day to receive PKT if 1 PKT is given to each address.

Although the code for this project will be released as open-source, the wallet password and other sensitive information will not be released.

### Milestones and payment

I understand there will be no up-front payment. I will provide milestone submissions when it is convenient for me to do so. If these milestones are accepted, I request that the NS transfer the amount of PKT necessary to cover the cost of the submitted deliverables **at the current market rate of PKT**, which I will declare in each milestone update. In any case, I accept that the total grants of this project cannot be any more than the "Maximum requested PKT contribution" specified above.

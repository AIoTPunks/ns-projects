I hereby submit this application in good faith and I attest that I have made no effort, nor do I

### No Pumping Statement
It is inherent to any communication that people may take it as a sign to trade the coin, and we acknowledge that a higher trading price of PKT is beneficial for many aspects of the project. However, we believe that bringing in speculators is harmful to the project for multiple reasons including dilution of the project vision as well as unreasonable price volatility. Therefore our communications will be focused first and foremost on the vision of a better internet and how we can work together to achieve that.

# Multi-Sig QT Wallet Project
* Project Name: MultiSig_QT_Wallet
* Contact Email: vishnu@gridfinity.com
* Project participants:
  * Vishnu Seesahai - Project Owner
  * *Other participants will be added as needed*
* Projected duration: 3 months
* Projected effort: 1 person per month = 3 person-months
* Requested PKT contribution: 40 million PKT
* Project status: **PROPOSED**

## Project summary

The objectives of the Multi-Sig QT Wallet is to expand the PKT network adoption by users who donâ€™t have the resources for using the current [text wallet](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktwallet), increase the network's density of nodes, and improve security & control by the implementation of multi-signature.

## 1. Project Relevance to the PKT Network
> _"The [objective of The Network Steward](https://pkt-cash.github.io/www.pkt.cash/steward/) is to reduce barriers of entry to network / VPN providers in the pursuit of increased individual autonomy and privacy"_

The creation of a new multi-sig QT PKT wallet can achieve the following benefits for the PKT Network:

* Expand the adoption of the PKT Network to users who do not have the technical skills, time, or resources to operate the current [open-source files of a wallet](http://github.com/pkt-cash/pktwallet), and run a [full node](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktd).
* Higher security & control, backup feature, and joint-account capability, provided by the multi-sig-transaction accessibility.
* Increase the density of the PKT Network nodes, to contribute to building the infrastructure of a functional decentralized network.

In the list of examples of [Projects Supported by The Network Steward](http://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/blob/master/readme.md), the first example is a wallet. As of the date of preparation of this proposal, the only available wallet is a [text-based wallet](http://github.com/pkt-cash/pktwallet).

## 2. Project Deliverables
The project will create new software for a standalone application, which should be downloaded and installed from an Installer. The installation will come bundled and ready to run a full-node, [PKTD](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktd), as well as a [PKT Wallet](http://github.com/pkt-cash/pktwallet) instance.

This deliverables are:
* New software for a standalone application.
* The software will be available under the [ISC](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC) license.
* Any artistic non-software assets will be available under the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.
* The maintainer of this software will be: Vishnu Seesahai
* The software will be hosted on https://github.com/pkt-cash, if the network steward wishes it so.

### 2.1 Development overview
The development will be carried out by using the QT Software toolkit due to its history of reliability, portability, and low memory usage.

The wallet will have a graphical user interface (GUI).
Compatible operating systems: MacOS, Unix.
The software will have future interoperability with Lightning Network.

For the avoidance of doubt, the development will not be an SPV wallet, and it will not have features for colored coins. This software will not have a low-resource footprint because it will run a full node.

### 2.2 Wallet target features
1. Send and receive transactions.
2. Send transactions to multiple addresses at once.
3. Batch transactions for large UTXO input sets.
4. Sign transactions.
5. Verify transactions.
6. Generate new regular addresses and new multi-sig addresses.
7. Export private keys and import new private keys.
8. Encrypt and decrypt messages.
9. Password-protect the wallet.
10. Save and restore the wallet backup from seed.

### 2.4 Team qualifications
Vishnu Seesahai is a mathematician and researcher specializing in engineering innovation across global markets, with a focus on stochastic processes, computing, and blockchains. He is also the founder of Healthmatica, a public benefit health tech. He is a graduate of Cornell with a BS in Computer Science and MS in Applied Mathematics from the Theory Center for Advanced Computing. He formerly served as SSWE at Ovid, the first health-tech company to offer full-text search of medical databases, and later CTO of Pixelpark AG, a subdivision of Bertelsmann. He is also the co-creator of the first DVAV (Digital Video Audio Village), purchased by Lionsgate Entertainment, which is currently in use on film/tv productions within their ecosystem.

## 3. Success Criteria
* At least one successful independent installation of the application.
* At least 90% achievement of the described features.

## 4. Payments
All payments shall be made to `pHdMacckyFaTYqufm4GPDijeWzs9USt1Ju`

## 5. Milestones
The following are milestones for the progress of the project by which the network steward can evaluate the success of the project.

### M0 - Kickoff
At the kickoff of the project, the network steward will grant 20 million PKT to the applicant and the project will begin.

### M1 - Minimum Viable Product
Milestone 1 will focus on developing the minimum features to send and receive transactions. Upon the completion of Milestone 1, a report will be written, and the applicant will seek approval from the network steward. The network steward shall pay 10 million PKT for the completion of this milestone.

The image below is a wireframe of M1:

### M2 - Complete version
Milestone 2 will be achieved when all target features listed in section 2.2 are developed and can be used used in a GUI. Upon completion of Milestone 2, a report will be written, and the applicant will seek approval from the network steward. Upon approval, payment of 10 million PKT will be issued.
At this point, the project will reach the end of its explicit funding; however, the applicant commits to the long term maintenance of the Multi-Sig QT Wallet software, and the Network Steward commits to continue their interest on the evolution of the software.

## 6. Legal
The applicant understands that the network steward is not a legal entity, and no part of this project constitutes any form of legal agreement. The applicant accepts that the network steward exists thanks to the effort of volunteers, and the applicant has no reasonable expectation of any action, payment, or communication from the network steward at any time. For their part, the applicant has no binding commitment or obligation at any time as a result of their participation in this project.

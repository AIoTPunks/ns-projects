### Milestone 0 (Kickoff)

After the project is accepted, the Network Steward will pay XXX PKT

### Milestone 1

#### Success criteria

milestone 1 was delivered correctly.

#### Payout
After a report is delivered on this milestone and it is approved by the NS, the NS will send **TODO** PKT.

### Milestone 2
